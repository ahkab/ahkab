""" About the method:
    This is an implicit method, it means that to compute dx(n+1)/dt the value of x in (n+1) is required.
    We don't know it, since it's our objective).
    This method, as all other implicit methods, allows us to write the derivative as:
     dx(n+1)/dt = x_coeff * x(n+1) + const                  (ii)

    The get_df method returns those two vectors.

    Gear's LMS interpolates the solution in a number of points equal to its order. Since it's a implicit
    method, one of these is x(n+1). The values x(n), x(n-1)... x(n-(order+2)) need to be supplied to the method.
    We can write x(t) as:
     x(t)   = a0 + a1*(t(n+1) -  t ) + a2*( t(n+1) - t )^2 + ...        (i)
    The equation has <order> a coefficients, which we need to determine.
    For this reason, we write a system of "order" equations in this way:
     x(n+1) = a0 + a1*(t(n+1) - t(n+1)) + a2*(t(n+1) - t(n+1))^2 + ...
     x(n)   = a0 + a1*(t(n+1) -  t(n) ) + a2*( t(n+1) - t(n) )^2 + ...
     x(n-1) = a0 + a1*(t(n+1) - t(n-1)) + a2*(t(n+1) - t(n-1))^2 + ...


    Which may be rewritten as:

      z = A * a

    z is the vector of known values of x
    A is a time dependant matrix
    a is a vector made of the a* coeffiecients

    We don't need to explicit ALL of the a* coeffiecients. What we are really looking for is the derivative of x
    in t(n+1), dx(n+1)/dt in short.
    If we differentiate the relation (i):
      dx(t)/dt = -a1 - 2*a2*( t(n+1) - t ) - 3*a3*( t(n+1) - t )^2 ...
    Which evaluated in t = t(n+1) gives:
      dx(n+1)/dt = -1 * a1

    Our objective is then a1.
    From the previsious system we write:
     a = A^-1 * z
    a1 is a[1,0], which may be extracted in this way:
     et = [0 1 0 0 0 0 ...] (order elements)
     a1 = et * a = et * A^-1 * z
    Because of the associative prperty of matrix multiplication, we can write:

     P  = et * A^-1
     a1 = P[1, :] * z

    But, we don't know z[0,0] = x(n+1), we can split the above relation:

     a1 = P[1, 0] * x(n+1) + P[1, 1:] * z[1:, 0]

    We arrived to the relation written above (ii)
     dx(n+1)/dt = x_coeff * x(n+1) + const = -1*a1

    So:
     x_coeff = -1 * P[1, 0]
     const   = -1 * P[1, 1:] * z[1:, 0]

    This module uses a faster way to compute the values that doesn't require to invert the matrix.
    Anyway, from a theorical point of view, the above applies.
