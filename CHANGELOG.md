#Changelog

Version 0.18 represents the culmination of almost two months of efforts, yet
another step in the current time-based release scheme.

This release features support for the Fourier (.FOUR) and Fast Fourier Transform
directives (.FFT). Piece-wise linear functions are also now supported in Python,
with extra features like a repeat directory to enable periodicity.

Moreover, as in the previous releases, several commits were devoted to improving
the documentation: you can find the new, improved documentation online at
http://ahkab.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

### Features added:

* FEATURES

* Add .FOUR and .FFT support
* Add PWL waveforms (available from python only)

### Backwards incompatible changes:

* AC analyses are from now defined in Hz (compliant with SPICE). This also means
  that there is no omega (accessed through 'w') in the results set, it is now
  replaced by a frequency vector, expressed in Hz and accessed as 'f'.

User code can be usually easily fixed substituting ``2*pi*r[w]`` with ``r[f]``
or the like. Sorry for any trouble this creates.

### Changes from contributors and pull requests merged:

*None.* 

### Bugs fixed, short list:

BUGFIX: Fix opening of files in system that do not default to utf-8
BUGFIX: Suppress error message on Windows
BUGFIX: Use all assumptions, fix #32
BUGFIX: fix reading the netlist from stdin
BUGFIX: Use different options for SH and BFPSS
BUGFIX: no DC value -> return t=0
BUGFIX: convert to uppercase before comparison

## Changelog for v 0.17

Version 0.17 represents the culmination of 15 days of efforts, yet another step
in the current time-based release scheme.

This release features a new memoization system, AM and FM time functions,
improved docs and error message. We also got rid of the last instances of
`np.mat` in the code.

Moreover, as in the previous releases, several commits were devoted to improving
the documentation: you can find the new, improved documentation online at
http://ahkab.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

### Features added:

* FEATURES

* Implement a memoization system.
* Replace `mytime_function.value()` with `mytime_function(time)`.
* Add AM to the time functions.
* Add the SFFM time function.
* `find_vde_index()` now allows for `elem` and `part_id` args.
* `remove_elem()` now allows `elem` and `part_id` args.

### Backwards incompatible changes:

* the time functions have been moved to their own module, named
  `time_functions.py`. This means code referring to the `sin`, `pulse` and `exp`
  functions needs to change from `devices.sin` to `time_functions.sin`.
* You now need to call `set_results()` to set `pss_solution` data.

### Changes from contributors and pull requests merged:

*None.* 

### Bugs fixed, short list:

BUGFIX: plotting: remember to set the active figure.
BUGFIX: fix a bug in `circuit.remove_elem()`, add tests.
BUGFIX: fix a bug in `circuit.find_vde()`, add tests.
BUGFIX: fix error message in circuit.py.
BUGFIX: Do not ask for prediction if we don't have enough points.

## Changelog for v 0.16

Version 0.16 represents the culmination of 1 month of efforts, yet another step
in the current time-based release scheme.

### Features added:

This release brings the test coverage of the codebase over the 80% milestone for
the first time. It also features a faster substitution algorithm for symbolic
simulations, we empoly the ``tabulate`` module more extensively, producing a
prettier output (for example ``print_short()`` now prints a pretty table.)

Internally, We removed occurrences of ``np.matrix``, in favor of ``np.array``,
according to the overall planned switch in the library. This should be
completely transparent to the user.

A few changes that have been introduced are *incompatible* with the previous
releases:

* The axis iterators ``utilities.log_axis_iterator`` and
  ``utilities.lin_axis_iterator`` now follow the syntax ``(min, max, points)``.
* The solution method ``solution.asmatrix()`` has been renamed to
  ``solution.asarray()``.
* We droppped the (undocumented) support for accessing singularities in
  ``pz_solution`` as ``'Re(p0)'`` and ``'Im(p0)'``. Hopefully, being
  undocumented it had little use. Please use ``numpy.real(r['p0'])`` or
  ``numpy.imag(r['p0'])`` to achieve the same result.
* Remove ``printing.table_print()`` for ``print(printing.table())``.

We apologize about the above, we believe the technical debt we paid with the
changes above makes up for the discomfort to our userbase.

Moreover, as in the previous releases, several commits were devoted to improving
the documentation: you can find the new, improved documentation online at
http://ahkab.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

### Issues fixed

* #29 - ``ahkab`` should now work well in IPython running under Python2 again.

### Changes from contributors and pull requests merged:

*None.*

* BUGFIX: fix iterator off-by-one in ``symbolic_solution``
* BUGFIX: key misses in ``symbolic_solution`` raise ``KeyErrors``
* BUGFIX: fix slicing in the solution (use it too)
* BUGFIX: ``dc_solution.values()`` now slices along the correct axis
* BUGFIX: ``load_csv()`` raises ``ValueError``
* BUGFIX: key misses raise ``KeyErrors``
* BUGFIX: prevent breaking readline on ipython, fixes #29
* BUGFIX: ensure w is always returned as real data, not cplx
* BUGFIX: Improve the iterators syntax, always include endpoints.
* BUGFIX: raise ``KeyError`` for key misses in ac_solution
* BUGFIX: ``items()`` returns no arrays.
* BUGFIX: ``values()`` returns a list, not an array.
* BUGFIX: fix iterator increment-by-one bug

## Changelog for v 0.14

Version 0.14 represents the culmination of three months of efforts, yet another step in the current time-based release scheme.
